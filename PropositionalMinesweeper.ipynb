    "# Minesweeper with propositional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the project\n",
    "The goal of the project is to implement an **intelligent agent** capable of autonomously playing the *Minesweeper* game using ***propositional logic***. The code base used is the one proposed by Harvard, available at [this link](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/1/minesweeper.zip).  \n",
    "The structure of the application, including the user interface (UI), was already provided, however, the implementation of the agent was done entirely by me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Minesweeper\n",
    "Minesweeper is a single-player logic game whose goal is to discover all the cells in a grid that do not contain mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minesweeper Features:\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: The player's actions do not affect the outcome of the game randomly. Every action has a predictable outcome.\n",
    "- **Fully Observable**: Once a cell is discovered, the information about that cell is completely visible to the player.\n",
    "- **Game Environment**: A grid* of hidden cells, some of which contain mines**, each discovered cell shows the number of adjacent mines.\n",
    "    - '*' 6x6.\n",
    "    - '**' in total there are 6 mines. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositional Logic\n",
    "Propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with *propositions* and their combinations through *logical connectives* such as **AND, OR, NOT**, etc. Through this logic it is possible to represent and manipulate knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Propositional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propositions**\n",
    "\n",
    " Propositions are statements that can be **true** or **false**.\n",
    " - Examples of propositions: \"Cell (1,1) is a mine\".\n",
    " - Propositions are usually denoted by capital letters, for example,:\\( C_1_1 \\).\n",
    " \n",
    " **Logical Connectives**\n",
    " \n",
    " Logical connectives are operators used to combine propositions and form more complex logical expressions.\n",
    " - **AND (∧)**: The conjunction of two propositions is true only if both propositions are true.\n",
    " - **OR (∨)**: The disjunction of two propositions is true if at least one of the propositions is true.\n",
    " - **NOT (¬)**: The negation of a proposition is true if the proposition is false.\n",
    " - **IMPLIES (→)**: The implication between two propositions is false only if the first proposition is true and the second is false.\n",
    " - **IFF (↔)**: The logical equivalence between two propositions is true if both propositions are both true or both false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "In propositional logic, through rules, such as modusponens or inference algorithms, such as **truth tables**, **forward chaining** and **backward chaining**, it is possible to deduce new propositions starting from existing propositions.\n",
    "\n"

    "## `Cell` class\n",
    "The `Cell` class represents a cell within the Minesweeper game, with information about its location, the presence of a mine, and the number of adjacent mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: in addition to the various `set` and `get` methods, it was necessary to override the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__eq__(self, other)`: To compare whether two cells are equal based on their position.\n",
    "- `__hash__(self)`: to make the cell hashable, allowing it to be used as a key in a dictionary or as an element of a set."
