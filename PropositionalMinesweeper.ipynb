    "# Minesweeper with propositional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the project\n",
    "The goal of the project is to implement an **intelligent agent** capable of autonomously playing the *Minesweeper* game using ***propositional logic***. The code base used is the one proposed by Harvard, available at [this link](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/1/minesweeper.zip).  \n",
    "The structure of the application, including the user interface (UI), was already provided, however, the implementation of the agent was done entirely by me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Minesweeper\n",
    "Minesweeper is a single-player logic game whose goal is to discover all the cells in a grid that do not contain mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minesweeper Features:\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: The player's actions do not affect the outcome of the game randomly. Every action has a predictable outcome.\n",
    "- **Fully Observable**: Once a cell is discovered, the information about that cell is completely visible to the player.\n",
    "- **Game Environment**: A grid* of hidden cells, some of which contain mines**, each discovered cell shows the number of adjacent mines.\n",
    "    - '*' 6x6.\n",
    "    - '**' in total there are 6 mines. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositional Logic\n",
    "Propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with *propositions* and their combinations through *logical connectives* such as **AND, OR, NOT**, etc. Through this logic it is possible to represent and manipulate knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Propositional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propositions**\n",
    "\n",
    " Propositions are statements that can be **true** or **false**.\n",
    " - Examples of propositions: \"Cell (1,1) is a mine\".\n",
    " - Propositions are usually denoted by capital letters, for example:\\( C_1_1 \\).\n",
    " \n",
    " **Logical Connectives**\n",
    " \n",
    " Logical connectives are operators used to combine propositions and form more complex logical expressions.\n",
    " - **AND (∧)**: The conjunction of two propositions is true only if both propositions are true.\n",
    " - **OR (∨)**: The disjunction of two propositions is true if at least one of the propositions is true.\n",
    " - **NOT (¬)**: The negation of a proposition is true if the proposition is false.\n",
    " - **IMPLIES (→)**: The implication between two propositions is false only if the first proposition is true and the second is false.\n",
    " - **IFF (↔)**: The logical equivalence between two propositions is true if both propositions are both true or both false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "In propositional logic, through rules, such as modus ponens or inference algorithms, such as **truth tables**, **forward chaining** and **backward chaining**, it is possible to deduce new propositions starting from existing propositions.\n",
    "\n"

    "## `Cell` class\n",
    "The `Cell` class represents a cell within the Minesweeper game, with information about its location, the presence of a mine, and the number of adjacent mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: in addition to the various `set` and `get` methods, it was necessary to override the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__eq__(self, other)`: To compare whether two cells are equal based on their position.\n",
    "- `__hash__(self)`: to make the cell hashable, allowing it to be used as a key in a dictionary or as an element of a set."

    "The approach used, based on the use of propositional logic to infer the presence of bombs, has proven to be effective and efficient.\n",
    "By avoiding traditional algorithms such as model checking, forward chaining and backward chaining, which are unusable for problems with high complexity due to combinatorial computation, the agent can perform inference in real time.\n",

    "A possible improvement could be to use **probability calculation** (based on the number of free cells and information on mine and safe cells) for when the agent has no information on the cells and is therefore forced to make random movements."
