# Minesweeper with Propositional Logic

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence course at the Master's Degree program in Applied Computer Science (Machine Learning and Big Data) at Parthenope University of Naples. It is based on the code provided by Harvard University, available [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/1/minesweeper.zip). The project has been customized to suit my use case and has been further refactored to be more object-oriented. The graphical interface has been minimally modified.

## Introduction

This Minesweeper project leverages propositional logic to enhance the classic game experience. The primary goal was to apply concepts from artificial intelligence to a familiar game, utilizing logic-based techniques to improve the decision-making process within the game. This project is part of the curriculum for the AI course at Parthenope University and showcases the integration of AI principles in game development.

## Features

- **Propositional Logic Integration:** Uses propositional logic to solve the Minesweeper game more efficiently.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Refactored the original code to be more modular and object-oriented, improving maintainability and readability.
- **Enhanced GUI:** The graphical user interface has been slightly modified to enhance the user experience while maintaining the core functionality.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
